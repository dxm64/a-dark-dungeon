How players progress:

Ideas for a dark dungeon:
- Visibility - level of transparency over dungeon viewer (light torch resets)
	- Some monsters are harder too see in dark (low contrast)
- Stamina - basic currency of the game, actions take effort + time
- Classes:
	- Warrior (+hp, +dmg)
	- Mage (+mn, faster access to Focus, spells, magic)
	- Rogue (+st, time advantage, bigger inv)
- Inventory - monsters will drop all kinds of items
- Wizard - 50% chance of miss with slashing
- Rogue - 0.25% chance of missing, but faster cooldown
- Warrior - 0.05% chance of miss with slash, higher damage
- Combat - if enemy is hit, enemy text flashes white-red-white-red-normal color
