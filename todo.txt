Actual TASKS:
- Save/Load game state from localStorage
- Save format as encoded base64 binary
- REST disables other actions for some amount of time

Combat:
- You can only see what's in front of you, as a list of enemies / objects
- Visibility constantly decreases, speed depends on type of torch, Light spell lasts longer than torches
- As visibility decreases, it affects accuracy of attacks - if room is pitch black, you're attacking blind which is based on luck
- If you hit something, enemy text will flash white-red for a bit
- Which enemy and how many depends on weapon / type of attack
- Swords: Short sword - faster, less range, fewer enemies affected; Long sword - slower, more range, more enemies affected
- Daggers: Always one target, limited in quantity, meelee attacks are fast, but low damage
- Spells: Some affect one enemy, some have an Area Of Effect that affects multiple (i.e. Poison cloud)

Possible enemies:
- Slime (green), variants: Big
- Undead (dark purple), low visibility, variants: Undead Soldier/Mage
- Bat (bright purple), evasive, noisy
- Cockroach (dark gray), harmless, worthless
- Rat (brown), gives rat meat, slow, weak attack, variants: Big rat, Undead Rat
- Spider (dark brown), gives web, jaws, fur, can be poisonious
- Goblin (dark green), attracted to magical objects, can steal from you

Possible items:
- Swords (short, long, range influences how many get hit if multiple, dmg)
- Bows (shoots arrows, limited in quantity)
- Spells
	- fireball
	- ice (enemies freeze, become light blue text)
	- poison gas (AoE, good for multiple, enemies flash purple?)
	- light spell (longer than torch)
- Throw dagger (limited by how many you have)
- Potions (health, mana, stamina, higher dmg, faster cooldown, faster regen, see in the dark)

How players progress:
- Gain levels to get 'Go up stairs' actions
- Rooms are divided by level and difficulty, they can stick around as long as they want and farm
- Random encounters with various enemies
- Random events?
- Sometimes you need a key, or you need to construct an object, or kill a boss
- Boss fights: Enemies come in waves, then you fight the big fella

Ideas for a dark dungeon:
- Visibility - level of transparency over dungeon viewer (light torch resets)
	- Some monsters are harder too see in dark (low contrast)
- Stamina - basic currency of the game, actions take effort + time
- Classes:
	- Warrior (+hp, +dmg)
	- Mage (+mn, faster access to Focus, spells, magic)
	- Rogue (+st, time advantage, bigger inv)
- Inventory - monsters will drop all kinds of items
- Wizard - 50% chance of miss with slashing
- Rogue - 0.25% chance of missing, but faster cooldown
- Warrior - 0.05% chance of miss with slash, higher damage
- Combat - if enemy is hit, enemy text flashes white-red-white-red-normal color
